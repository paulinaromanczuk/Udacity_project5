# Udacity_project5 - analysis of borrowers
## Prosper Loan Dataset exploration



## Dataset

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.


## Summary of Findings

Majority (ca. 55%) of customers are falling within income range 25-75k  
Top 5 categories of loans are: Debt consolidaton, not available, Other, Business and Home Improvement  
Around 5% of customers defaulted and 2% are late with their payment  
50.5% of loan-takers are also homeowners  
Income data could not be verified for 7.6% of borrowers  
60% of loan takers are employed, 25% are working full time, less than 10% are self-employed  
Majority of loans have less than 5k value, and we see spikes in "round" numbers, like  10k or 15k. Maximum amount of loan is 35k, and 75% of them are below 12k  
For most of loan-takers it's their first loan with Prosper and most of loans are given for 36 months term  
Monthly payment for majority of loans is lower than 500 dollars, loan takers are quite burdened with debt (for most of them their monthly liabilities are taking 10-30% of their monthly income). Most borrowers have APR between 1.5-2.5%, and loans taken for Cosmedic procedures and Household expenses have highest median BorrowerAPR  
Almost 60% of loans granted by Prosper are granted to Medium Risk Borrower - categories B, C and D  
Where you are employed, working full time or are self-employed, there are biggest changes that you will be at least middle class  
There seems to be a clear positive correlation between the amount of loan taken and how much the monthly repayment is  
It's visible that Prosper has a rather approproate system of assigning credit risk - we see that the highest number of defaulted customers had already assigned "High Risk" category. 40% of defaulted customers had already assigned highest risk categories  
Prosper is compensating this higher risk with higher rates given to customers with E and HR ratings  
The longer the term and the smaller the value of loans, the higher interest rate it has applied - the highest amounts tend to rather sit within longer terms and have less than 0.2 APR rate  
Variable that has most negative impact on BorrowerAPR (from customer's perspective) for High Risk Customers is lower bound of credit score
